# Future enhancements

Figure out how to request and send patches using SysEx messages. The device
supports sending a patch via the settings menu, but hopefully this can be
triggered by a SysEx message. May have to use WireShark and the Behringer
SynthTool application, although the latter isn't available for Linux. If the
SysEx support is there, then add librarian support.
